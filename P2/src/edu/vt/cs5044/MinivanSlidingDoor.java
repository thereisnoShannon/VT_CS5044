/**
 * One brief paragraph of operational rules defines the system requirements
 * The following requests always succeed (even if no state is changed):
 *      Lock, unlock, or close the door
 *      Change the gear
 * The childsafe feature can only be accessed when the door is open
 * A request to open the door – via dashboard button or outside handle – succeeds only if:
 *      The gear is in park AND the door is unlocked
 * A request to open the door – via the inside handle – succeeds only if:
 *      The childsafe feature is disengaged 
 *      AND the gear is in park AND the door is unlocked
 *      
 * Methods:
 * The initial conditions to be set by the constructor are given in the assignment page
 * The accessors are all just simple one-line getter methods
 * Each mutator returns a single Result value to describe the result of the requested action
 * Result is one of several enumerated types used in this assignment; see below for details
 * Before you start: Please be sure to very carefully review all of the Result file comments
 * You must honor the precedence listed in the comments, whenever multiple results apply
 * Some of these may seem counter-intuitive; the priorities are based on safety concerns
 * Java has a special enum type to represent a custom set of unique fixed values
 * An enum is declared as (and mostly acts as) a special kind of class:
 * public enum Gear { PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE; }
 * Values are arbitrary and human-readable identifiers, in all caps by convention
 * Specify values in code by type-dot-value: Gear.PARK or Gear.DRIVE
 * An enum reference may be null just like any other object reference
 * However, several features are handled like primitives instead:
 * Declaration and assignment is similar to a primitive: Gear myGear = Gear.NEUTRAL;
 * Comparison is also handled like a primitive, using == or !=
 * Type-safety is strictly enforced by the compiler, eliminating several common kinds of errors
 * In Project 2 there are three enumerated types: Gear, Direction, and Result
